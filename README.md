Hi everyone. 
I am working on my own personal AI assistant named Narvis(Not Jarvis ;).
This is done in free time so updates may be rare.
Heres the plan


Speech/Interaction
- speech -> text (talking to it)
- text -> speech (it talking to me)
- understanding language (probably some sort of LLM api)
- memory
  
Knowledge and reasoning
- general knowledge
- math/logic
- planning/scheduling
  
System Control
- run pc programs
- manage files
- control OS
  
Web/API access
- search the web
- use api data
